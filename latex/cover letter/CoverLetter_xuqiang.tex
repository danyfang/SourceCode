I've known KPMG several years ago when I was attending a job fair with my friends, who studied Accounting. Since then I've got to know KPMG as one of the Big Four Auditors, and one of the most well-known companies in the world.\\

Back then I would never have thought that one day I will be applying for a job at KPMG, but some time ago I read this report about artificial intelligence replacing jobs at traditional accounting area, I started to get a mindset that says, 'Yes, accounting has to deal with numbers all the time and machines are good at numbers, we surely can use machines to help people do accounting jobs and especially those that require a lot of repetitions.'\\

Of course, as a master student majoring in Data Science, I know what machines are capable of and what data are capable of. Also i'm aware that audit and assurance don't work as the same way as before, they must incorporate new technologies, not only to solve more complicated problems but also be well-prepared for a bright future in a digitalized world. I dedicate to work as a data scientist in the future, I will be able to come up with solutions that exploits state-of-the-art technologies in our area, by combining these with audit and assurance, we will be able to well-prepare KPMG Audit \& Assurance for the future.
