# Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node root,
# return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.
#
# Example :
#
# Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.
#
# The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:
#
#           4
#         /   \
#       2      6
#      / \
#     1   3
#
# while the minimum difference in this tree is 1,
# it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
#
# Note:
# - The size of the BST will be between 2 and 100.
# - The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.
