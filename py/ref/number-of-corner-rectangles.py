# Time:  O(n * m^2), n is the number of rows with 1s, m is the number of cols with 1s
# Space: O(n * m)

# Given a grid where each entry is only 0 or 1, find the number of corner rectangles.
#
# A corner rectangle is 4 distinct 1s on the grid that form an axis-aligned rectangle.
# Note that only the corners need to have the value 1. Also, all four 1s used must be distinct.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: grid =
# [[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
#  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
#  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
#  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: There is only one corner rectangle, with corners grid[1][2], grid[1][4], grid[3][2], grid[3][4].
#
# Example 2:
# Input: grid =
# [[1, 1, 1],
#  [1, 1, 1],
#  [1, 1, 1]]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: There are four 2x2 rectangles, four 2x3 and 3x2 rectangles, and one 3x3 rectangle.
#
# Example 3:
# Input: grid =
# [[1, 1, 1, 1]]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Rectangles must have four distinct corners.
# Note:
# - The number of rows and columns of grid will each be in the range [1, 200].
# - Each grid[i][j] will be either 0 or 1.
# - The number of 1s in the grid will be at most 6000.
