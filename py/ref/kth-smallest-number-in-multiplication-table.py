# Nearly every one have used the Multiplication Table.
# But could you find out the k-th smallest number quickly from the multiplication table?
#
# Given the height m and the length n of a m * n Multiplication Table, and a positive integer k,
# you need to return the k-th smallest number in this table.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
# Output:
# Explanation:
# The Multiplication Table:
# 1	2	3
# 2	4	6
# 3	6	9
#
# The 5-th smallest number is 3 (1, 2, 2, 3, 3).
# Example 2:
# Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
# Output:
# Explanation:
# The Multiplication Table:
# 1	2	3
# 2	4	6
#
# The 6-th smallest number is 6 (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6).
# Note:
# The m and n will be in the range [1, 30000].
# The k will be in the range [1, m * n]
