# Given the root of a binary tree, then value v and depth d,
# you need to add a row of nodes with value v at the given depth d.
# The root node is at depth 1.
#
# The adding rule is: given a positive integer depth d,
# for each NOT null tree nodes N in depth d-1, create two tree nodes
# with value v as N's left subtree root and right subtree root.
# And N's original left subtree should be the left subtree of
# the new left subtree root,
# its original right subtree should be the right subtree of
# the new right subtree root.
# If depth d is 1 that means there is no depth d-1 at all,
# then create a tree node with value v as the new root of
# the whole original tree,
# and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
# A binary tree as following:
#        4
#      /   \
#     2     6
#    / \   /
#   3   1 5
#
# v = 1
#
# d = 2
#
# Output:
#        4
#       / \
#      1   1
#     /     \
#    2       6
#   / \     /
#  3   1   5
#
# Example 2:
# Input:
# A binary tree as following:
#       4
#      /
#     2
#    / \
#   3   1
#
# v = 1
#
# d = 3
#
# Output:
#       4
#      /
#     2
#    / \
#   1   1
#  /     \
# 3       1
# Note:
# 1. The given d is in range [1, maximum depth of the given tree + 1].
# 2. The given binary tree has at least one tree node.
