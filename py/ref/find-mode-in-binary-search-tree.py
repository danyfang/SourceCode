# Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates,
# find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.
#
# Assume a BST is defined as follows:
#
# The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
# For example:
# Given BST [1,null,2,2],
#   1
#     \
#      2
#     /
#   2
# return [2].
#
# Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.
#
# Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space?
# (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

# Definition for a binary tree node.
