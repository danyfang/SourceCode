# We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.
#
# We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].
# Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.
#
# At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.
# (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].)
#
# Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.
# It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.
#
# Example:
# Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
# A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# which are both strictly increasing.
#
# Note:
# - A, B are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the range [1, 1000].
# - A[i], B[i] are integer values in the range [0, 2000].
