# Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest distance among all the pairs.
# The distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference between A and B.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
# nums = [1,3,1]
# k = 1
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# Here are all the pairs:
# (1,3) -> 2
# (1,1) -> 0
# (3,1) -> 2
# Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.
#
# Note:
# 2 <= len(nums) <= 10000.
# 0 <= nums[i] < 1000000.
# 1 <= k <= len(nums) * (len(nums) - 1) / 2.
