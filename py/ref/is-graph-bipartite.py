# Given a graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.
#
# Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into
# two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has
# one node in A and another node in B.
#
# The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j
# for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.
# Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.
# There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i,
# and it doesn't contain any element twice.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
# Output: true
# Explanation:
# The graph looks like this:
# 0----1
# |    |
# |    |
# 3----2
# We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
# Output: false
# Explanation:
# The graph looks like this:
# 0----1
# | \  |
# |  \ |
# 3----2
# We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent ubsets.
#
# Note:
# - graph will have length in range [1, 100].
# - graph[i] will contain integers in range [0, graph.length - 1].
# - graph[i] will not contain i or duplicate values.
