# cpp_data_structures
data structures and algorithms are probably the most core subjects in modern computer science. I have always been searching for ways to improve my programming skill and i figure that practicing implementing basic data structures and algorithms should help.
So this is why i created this repository!

The data structures are all written in c++, before i did't really know the difference between different versions of c++ standard library, but with the progress of learning, i gradually transformed into c++11 programming style. So most of these programs should be able to be compiled using c++11-supported compilers. My computer is macOS Sierra, I installed Xcode Version 8.0(8A218a) on my machine and i use clang++ -std=c++11 to compile all these programs!


Keep learning, enjoy learning!
