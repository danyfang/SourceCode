# Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves,
# judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.
#
# The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character.
# The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down).
# The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: "UD"
# Output: true
# Example 2:
# Input: "LL"
# Output: false
