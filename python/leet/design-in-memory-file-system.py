# Time:  ls: O(l + klogk), l is the path length, k is the number of entries in the last level directory
#        mkdir: O(l)
#        addContentToFile: O(l + c), c is the content size
#        readContentFromFile: O(l + c)
# Space: O(n + s), n is the number of dir/file nodes, s is the total content size.

# Design an in-memory file system to simulate the following functions:
#
# ls: Given a path in string format. If it is a file path,
#     return a list that only contains this file's name.
#     If it is a directory path, return the list of file and directory names in this directory.
#     Your output (file and directory names together) should in lexicographic order.
#
# mkdir: Given a directory path that does not exist,
#       you should make a new directory according to the path.
#       If the middle directories in the path don't exist either,
#       you should create them as well. This function has void return type.
#
# addContentToFile: Given a file path and file content in string format.
#                   If the file doesn't exist, you need to create that file containing given content.
#                   If the file already exists, you need to append given content to original content.
#                   This function has void return type.
#
# readContentFromFile: Given a file path, return its content in string format.
#
# Example:
# Input:
# ["FileSystem","ls","mkdir","addContentToFile","ls","readContentFromFile"]
# [[],["/"],["/a/b/c"],["/a/b/c/d","hello"],["/"],["/a/b/c/d"]]
# Output:
# [null,[],null,null,["a"],"hello"]
#
# Note:
# 1. You can assume all file or directory paths are absolute paths
#   which begin with / and do not end with / except that the path is just "/".
# 2. You can assume that all operations will be passed valid parameters and
#   users will not attempt to retrieve file content or list a directory or file that does not exist.
# 3. You can assume that all directory names and file names only contain lower-case letters,
#   and same names won't exist in the same directory.
