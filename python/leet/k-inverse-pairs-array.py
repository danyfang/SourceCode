# Time:  O(n * k)
# Space: O(k)

# Given two integers n and k, find how many different arrays consist of numbers
# from 1 to n such that there are exactly k inverse pairs.
#
# We define an inverse pair as following: For ith and jth element in the array,
#     if i < j and a[i] > a[j] then it's an inverse pair; Otherwise, it's not.
#
# Since the answer may very large, the answer should be modulo 109 + 7.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 3, k = 0
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# Only the array [1,2,3] which consists of numbers from 1 to 3 has exactly 0 inverse pair.
# Example 2:
# Input: n = 3, k = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# The array [1,3,2] and [2,1,3] have exactly 1 inverse pair.
# Note:
# The integer n is in the range [1, 1000] and k is in the range [0, 1000].
