# Time:  O((|E| + |V|) * log|V|) = O(|E| * log|V|) by using binary heap,
#        if we can further to use Fibonacci heap, it would be O(|E| + |V| * log|V|)
# Space: O(|E| + |V|) = O(|E|)

# There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.
#
# Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w),
# where u is the source node, v is the target node,
# and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
#
# Now, we send a signal from a certain node K.
# How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.
#
# Note:
# - N will be in the range [1, 100].
# - K will be in the range [1, N].
# - The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
# - All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 1 <= w <= 100.
