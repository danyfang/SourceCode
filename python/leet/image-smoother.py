# Given a 2D integer matrix M representing the gray scale of an image,
# you need to design a smoother to make the gray scale of each cell becomes
# the average gray scale (rounding down) of all the 8 surrounding cells and itself.
# If a cell has less than 8 surrounding cells, then use as many as you can.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
# [[1,1,1],
#  [1,0,1],
#  [1,1,1]]
# Output:
# [[0, 0, 0],
#  [0, 0, 0],
#  [0, 0, 0]]
# Explanation:
# For the point (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2): floor(3/4) = floor(0.75) = 0
# For the point (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1): floor(5/6) = floor(0.83333333) = 0
# For the point (1,1): floor(8/9) = floor(0.88888889) = 0
# Note:
# The value in the given matrix is in the range of [0, 255].
# The length and width of the given matrix are in the range of [1, 150].
