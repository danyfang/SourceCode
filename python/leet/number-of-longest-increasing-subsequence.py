# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
# Example 2:
# Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are
# 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
# Note: Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed
# to be fit in 32-bit signed int.
