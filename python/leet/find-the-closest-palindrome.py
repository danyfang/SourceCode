# Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome.
#
# The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: "123"
# Output: "121"
# Note:
# The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.
# If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.
