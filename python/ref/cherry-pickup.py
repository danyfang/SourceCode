# In a N x N grid representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.
#
# 0 means the cell is empty, so you can pass through;
# 1 means the cell contains a cherry, that you can pick up and pass through;
# -1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.
# Your task is to collect maximum number of cherries possible by following the rules below:
#
# Starting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (N-1, N-1) by moving right
# or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1);
#
# After reaching (N-1, N-1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path cells;
# When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up and the cell becomes an empty cell (0);
# If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (N-1, N-1), then no cherries can be collected.
# Example 1:
# Input: grid =
# [[0, 1, -1],
#  [1, 0, -1],
#  [1, 1,  1]]
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
# The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
# 4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes [[0,1,-1],[0,0,-1],[0,0,0]].
# Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.
# The total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.
#
# Note:
# - grid is an N by N 2D array, with 1 <= N <= 50.
# - Each grid[i][j] is an integer in the set {-1, 0, 1}.
# - It is guaranteed that grid[0][0] and grid[N-1][N-1] are not -1.
