# Given a positive integer N,
# how many ways can we write it as a sum of
# consecutive positive integers?
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: 5
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 5 = 5 = 2 + 3
# Example 2:
#
# Input: 9
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 9 = 9 = 4 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 4
# Example 3:
#
# Input: 15
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 15 = 15 = 8 + 7 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
# Note: 1 <= N <= 10 ^ 9.
