# We have a grid of 1s and 0s; the 1s in a cell represent bricks.
# A brick will not drop if and
# only if it is directly connected to the top of the grid,
# or at least one of its (4-way) adjacent bricks will not drop.
#
# We will do some erasures sequentially.
# Each time we want to do the erasure at the location (i, j),
# the brick (if it exists) on that location will disappear,
# and then some other bricks may drop because of that erasure.
#
# Return an array representing the number of bricks that
# will drop after each erasure in sequence.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
# grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,1,0]]
# hits = [[1,0]]
# Output: [2]
# Explanation:
# If we erase the brick at (1, 0), the brick at (1, 1) and (1, 2) will drop.
# So we should return 2.
#
# Example 2:
# Input:
# grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
# hits = [[1,1],[1,0]]
# Output: [0,0]
# Explanation:
# When we erase the brick at (1, 0), the brick at (1, 1)
# has already disappeared due to the last move.
# So each erasure will cause no bricks dropping.
# Note that the erased brick (1, 0) will not be counted as a dropped brick.
#
# Note:
# - The number of rows and columns in the grid will be in the range [1, 200].
# - The number of erasures will not exceed the area of the grid.
# - It is guaranteed that each erasure will be different from
#  any other erasure, and located inside the grid.
# - An erasure may refer to a location with no brick -
#   if it does, no bricks drop.
