# Space: O(n)

# Implement a MyCalendarThree class to store your events. A new event can always be added.
#
# Your class will have one method, book(int start, int end).
# Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval [start, end),
# the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
#
# A K-booking happens when K events have some non-empty intersection
# (ie., there is some time that is common to all K events.)
#
# For each call to the method MyCalendar.book,
# return an integer K representing the largest integer such that there exists a K-booking in the calendar.
#
# Your class will be called like this:
# MyCalendarThree cal = new MyCalendarThree(); MyCalendarThree.book(start, end)
# Example 1:
# MyCalendarThree();
# MyCalendarThree.book(10, 20); // returns 1
# MyCalendarThree.book(50, 60); // returns 1
# MyCalendarThree.book(10, 40); // returns 2
# MyCalendarThree.book(5, 15); // returns 3
# MyCalendarThree.book(5, 10); // returns 3
# MyCalendarThree.book(25, 55); // returns 3
# Explanation:
# The first two events can be booked and are disjoint, so the maximum K-booking is a 1-booking.
# The third event [10, 40) intersects the first event, and the maximum K-booking is a 2-booking.
# The remaining events cause the maximum K-booking to be only a 3-booking.
# Note that the last event locally causes a 2-booking, but the answer is still 3 because
# eg. [10, 20), [10, 40), and [5, 15) are still triple booked.
# Note:
# - The number of calls to MyCalendarThree.book per test case will be at most 400.
# - In calls to MyCalendarThree.book(start, end), start and end are integers in the range [0, 10^9].
