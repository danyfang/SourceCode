# A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.
#
# The world is modeled as a 2-D array of cells,
# where 0 represents uninfected cells,
# and 1 represents cells contaminated with the virus.
# A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells,
# on the shared boundary.
#
# Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall.
# Resources are limited.
# Each day, you can install walls around only one region --
# the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that
# threatens the most uninfected cells the following night.
# There will never be a tie.
#
# Can you save the day? If so, what is the number of walls required?
# If not, and the world becomes fully infected, return the number of walls used.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: grid =
# [[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
#  [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
#  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
#  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
# Output: 10
# Explanation:
# There are 2 contaminated regions.
# On the first day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the left. The board after the virus spreads is:
#
# [[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
#  [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
#  [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
#  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]
#
# On the second day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the right. The virus is fully contained.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: grid =
# [[1,1,1],
#  [1,0,1],
#  [1,1,1]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Even though there is only one cell saved, there are 4 walls built.
# Notice that walls are only built on the shared boundary of two different cells.
#
# Example 3:
# Input: grid =
# [[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],
#  [1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1],
#  [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
# Output: 13
#
# Explanation: The region on the left only builds two new walls.
# Note:
# - The number of rows and columns of grid will each be in the range [1, 50].
# - Each grid[i][j] will be either 0 or 1.
# - Throughout the described process, there is always a contiguous viral region
#   that will infect strictly more uncontaminated squares in the next round.
