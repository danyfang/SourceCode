# Time:  +:        O(d * t), t is the number of terms,
#                            d is the average degree of terms
#        -:        O(d * t)
#        *:        O(d * t^2)
#        eval:     O(d * t)
#        to_list:  O(d * tlogt)
# Space: O(e + d * t), e is the number of evalvars

# Given an expression such as expression = "e + 8 - a + 5" and
# an evaluation map such as {"e": 1}
# (given in terms of evalvars = ["e"] and evalints = [1]),
# return a list of tokens representing the simplified expression,
# such as ["-1*a","14"]
# - An expression alternates chunks and symbols,
#   with a space separating each chunk and symbol.
# - A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable,
#   or a non-negative integer.
# - A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.)
#   Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never
#   have a leading coefficient or unary operator like "2x" or "-x".
#
# Expressions are evaluated in the usual order:
# brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.
# For example, expression = "1 + 2 * 3" has an answer of ["7"].
#
# The format of the output is as follows:
# - For each term of free variables with non-zero coefficient,
#   we write the free variables within a term in sorted order
#   lexicographically.
#   For example, we would never write a term like "b*a*c", only "a*b*c".
# - Terms have degree equal to the number of free variables being multiplied,
#   counting multiplicity. (For example, "a*a*b*c" has degree 4.)
#   We write the largest degree terms of our answer first,
#   breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of
#   the term.
# - The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an
#    asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.)
#    A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.
# - An example of a well formatted answer is
#  ["-2*a*a*a", "3*a*a*b", "3*b*b", "4*a", "5*c", "-6"]
# - Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.
#    For example, an expression of "0" has an output of [].
#
# Examples:
#
# Input: expression = "e + 8 - a + 5", evalvars = ["e"], evalints = [1]
# Output: ["-1*a","14"]
#
# Input: expression = "e - 8 + temperature - pressure",
# evalvars = ["e", "temperature"], evalints = [1, 12]
# Output: ["-1*pressure","5"]
#
# Input: expression = "(e + 8) * (e - 8)", evalvars = [], evalints = []
# Output: ["1*e*e","-64"]
#
# Input: expression = "7 - 7", evalvars = [], evalints = []
# Output: []
#
# Input: expression = "a * b * c + b * a * c * 4", evalvars = [], evalints = []
# Output: ["5*a*b*c"]
#
# Input: expression =
#       "((a - b) * (b - c) + (c - a)) * ((a - b) + (b - c) * (c - a))",
# evalvars = [], evalints = []
# Output:
# ["-1*a*a*b*b","2*a*a*b*c","-1*a*a*c*c","1*a*b*b*b","-1*a*b*b*c","-1*a*b*c*c",
#  "1*a*c*c*c","-1*b*b*b*c","2*b*b*c*c","-1*b*c*c*c","2*a*a*b","-2*a*a*c","-2*a*b*b",
#  "2*a*c*c","1*b*b*b","-1*b*b*c","1*b*c*c","-1*c*c*c","-1*a*a","1*a*b","1*a*c","-1*b*c"]
#
# Note:
# - expression will have length in range [1, 1000].
# - evalvars, evalints will have equal lengths in range [0, 1000].
