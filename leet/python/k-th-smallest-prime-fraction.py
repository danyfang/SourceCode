# https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-prime-fraction/discuss/115545/O(n)

# A sorted list A contains 1, plus some number of primes.
# Then, for every p < q in the list, we consider the fraction p/q.
#
# What is the K-th smallest fraction considered?
# Return your answer as an array of ints, where answer[0] = p and answer[1] = q.
#
# Examples:
# Input: A = [1, 2, 3, 5], K = 3
# Output: [2, 5]
# Explanation:
# The fractions to be considered in sorted order are:
# 1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3.
# The third fraction is 2/5.
#
# Input: A = [1, 7], K = 1
# Output: [1, 7]
#
# Note:
# - A will have length between 2 and 2000.
# - Each A[i] will be between 1 and 30000.
# - K will be between 1 and A.length * (A.length + 1) / 2.
