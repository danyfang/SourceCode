# Time:  O(n), n is the length of the word
# Space: O(d)

# Implement a magic directory with buildDict, and search methods.
#
# For the method buildDict, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to build a dictionary.
#
# For the method search, you'll be given a word, and judge whether
# if you modify exactly one character into another character in this word,
# the modified word is in the dictionary you just built.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]), Output: Null
# Input: search("hello"), Output: False
# Input: search("hhllo"), Output: True
# Input: search("hell"), Output: False
# Input: search("leetcoded"), Output: False
# Note:
# You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
# For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now.
# You could think about highly efficient algorithm after the contest.
# Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class MagicDictionary,
# as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see here for more details.
