# Given an integer array with no duplicates.
# A maximum tree building on this array is defined as follow:
#
# The root is the maximum number in the array.
# The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from left part subarray divided by the maximum number.
# The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from right part subarray divided by the maximum number.
# Construct the maximum tree by the given array and output the root node of this tree.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [3,2,1,6,0,5]
# Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:
#
#       6
#     /   \
#    3     5
#     \    /
#      2  0
#        \
#         1
# Note:
# The size of the given array will be in the range [1,1000].
