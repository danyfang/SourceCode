# There is a room with n lights which are turned on initially and
# 4 buttons on the wall.
# After performing exactly m unknown operations towards buttons,
# you need to return how many different kinds of status of
# the n lights could be.
#
# Suppose n lights are labeled as number [1, 2, 3 ..., n],
# function of these 4 buttons are given below:
#   1. Flip all the lights.
#   3. Flip lights with even numbers.
#   3. Flip lights with odd numbers.
#   4. Flip lights with (3k + 1) numbers, k = 0, 1, 2, ...
#
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 1, m = 1.
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Status can be: [on], [off]
# Example 2:
# Input: n = 2, m = 1.
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Status can be: [on, off], [off, on], [off, off]
# Example 3:
# Input: n = 3, m = 1.
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Status can be: [off, on, off], [on, off, on],
#                             [off, off, off], [off, on, on].
# Note: n and m both fit in range [0, 1000].
