# Time:  O(logn)
# Space: O(1)

# Given a sorted array consisting of only integers
# where every element appears twice except for one element
# which appears once. Find this single element that appears only once.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
# Output: 2
# Example 2:
# Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
# Output: 10
# Note: Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.
