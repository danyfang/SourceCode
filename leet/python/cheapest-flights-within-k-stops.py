# Time:  O((|E| + |V|) * log|V|) = O(|E| * log|V|),

# Space: O(|E| + |V|) = O(|E|)

# There are n cities connected by m flights. Each fight starts from city u and arrives at v with a price w.
#
# Now given all the cities and fights, together with starting city src and the destination dst,
# your task is to find the cheapest price from src to dst with up to k stops.
# If there is no such route, output -1.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
# n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
# src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
# Output: 200
# Explanation:
# The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 1 stop costs 200, as marked red in the picture.
#
# Example 2:
# Input:
# n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
# src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
# Output: 500
#
# Explanation:
# The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 0 stop costs 500, as marked blue in the picture.
# Note:
# - The number of nodes n will be in range [1, 100], with nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.
# - The size of flights will be in range [0, n * (n - 1) / 2].
# - The format of each flight will be (src, dst, price).
# - The price of each flight will be in the range [1, 10000].
# - k is in the range of [0, n - 1].
# - There will not be any duplicated flights or self cycles.
