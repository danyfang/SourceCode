# Time:  O(k * n^2)
# Space: O(n^2)

# On an NxN chessboard, a knight starts at the r-th row and c-th column and
# attempts to make exactly K moves. The rows and columns are 0 indexed,
# so the top-left square is (0, 0), and the bottom-right square is (N-1, N-1).
#
# A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below.
# Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.
#
# Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly
# at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.
#
# The knight continues moving until it has made exactly K moves or has moved off the chessboard.
# Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving.
#
# Example:
# Input: 3, 2, 0, 0
# Output: 0.0625
#
# Explanation: There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board.
# From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board.
# The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.
#
# Note:
# N will be between 1 and 25.
# K will be between 0 and 100.
# The knight always initially starts on the board.
