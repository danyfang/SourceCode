# In a given integer array A, we must move every element of A to
# either list B or list C. (B and C initially start empty.)
#
# Return true if and only if after such a move, it is possible that
# the average value of B is equal to the average value of C, and B and C are both non-empty.
#
# Example :
# Input:
# [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
# Output: true
# Explanation: We can split the array into [1,4,5,8] and [2,3,6,7], and both of them have the average of 4.5.
#
# Note:
# - The length of A will be in the range [1, 30].
# - A[i] will be in the range of [0, 10000].
