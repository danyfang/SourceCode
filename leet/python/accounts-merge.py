# Time:  O(nlogn), n is the number of total emails,
#                  and the max length ofemail is 320, p.s. {64}@{255}
# Space: O(n)

# Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings,
# where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name,
# and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.
#
# Now, we would like to merge these accounts.
# Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some email
# that is common to both accounts.
# Note that even if two accounts have the same name,
# they may belong to different people as people could have the same name.
# A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their
# accounts definitely have the same name.
#
# After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format:
# the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements
# are emails in sorted order.
# The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
# accounts = [["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"],
#             ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"],
#             ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"],
#             ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]
# Output: [["John", 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com',
#           'johnsmith@mail.com'],
#          ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]
#
# Explanation:
# The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common
# email "johnsmith@mail.com".
# The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email
# addresses are used by other accounts.
# We could return these lists in any order,
# for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'],
#                         ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'],
#                         ['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com',
#                          'johnsmith@mail.com']]
# would still be accepted.
#
# Note:
#
# The length of accounts will be in the range [1, 1000].
# The length of accounts[i] will be in the range [1, 10].
# The length of accounts[i][j] will be in the range [1, 30].
