# Time:  O(n^2)
# Space: O(n)

# There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not.
# Their friendship is transitive in nature.
# For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C,
# then A is an indirect friend of C.
# And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.
#
# Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class.
# If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other,
# otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
# [[1,1,0],
#  [1,1,0],
#  [0,0,1]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle.
# The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
#
# Example 2:
# Input:
# [[1,1,0],
#  [1,1,1],
#  [0,1,1]]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct friends,
# so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.
#
# Note:
# N is in range [1,200].
# M[i][i] = 1 for all students.
# If M[i][j] = 1, then M[j][i] = 1.
