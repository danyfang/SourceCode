# Given a positive integer n, find the number of non-negative integers less than
# or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: 5
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
# Here are the non-negative integers <= 5 with their corresponding binary representations:
# 0 : 0
# 1 : 1
# 2 : 10
# 3 : 11
# 4 : 100
# 5 : 101
# Among them, only integer 3 disobeys the rule (two consecutive ones) and the other 5 satisfy the rule.
# Note: 1 <= n <= 10^9
