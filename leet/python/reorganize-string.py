# Time:  O(nloga) = O(n), a is the size of alphabet
# Space: O(a) = O(1)

# Given a string S, check if the letters can be rearranged
# so that two characters that are adjacent to each other are not the same.
#
# If possible, output any possible result.  If not possible, return the empty string.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: S = "aab"
# Output: "aba"
# Example 2:
#
# Input: S = "aaab"
# Output: ""
#
# Note:
# - S will consist of lowercase letters and have length in range [1, 500].
